# DungeonDelver
 A 2D game prototype inspired by Gauntlet created for a school project using the SDL game engine. <br />
   
 Design <br />
 Player character moves around a darkened dungeon with limited visibility. <br /> 
 PC can shoot a fireball with a left click and can create light with a right click - but can not do both together. Holding right click makes visibility radius grow. <br />
 PC moves using WASD controls. <br />
 Skeletons spawn in the dark and will approach and attack player if the player enters their line of sight (a larger sight radius) making sounds as they do so. <br />
 Player gains points by defeating skeletons. <br />
   
 Current state <br />
 FogOfWar not implemented <br />
 Light not implemented (currently logs to console) <br />
   
 Installation <br />
 Game can be run using Windows Visual Studio. <br />
 SDL files included in External. <br />
 Visual Studios solution file is located in DungeonDelver folder.
