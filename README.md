# DungeonDelver
 A 2D game prototype inspired by Gauntlet created for a school project using the SDL game engine.
 
 Design
 Player character moves around a darkened dungeon with limited visibility. 
 PC can shoot a fireball with a left click and can create light with a right click - but can not do both together. Holding right click makes visibility radius grow.
 PC moves using WASD controls.
 Skeletons spawn in the dark and will approach and attack player if the player enters their line of sight (a larger sight radius) making sounds as they do so.
 Player gains points by defeating skeletons.
 
 Current state
 FogOfWar not implemented
 Light not implemented (currently logs to console)
 
 Installation
 Game can be run using Windows Visual Studio. 
 SDL files included in External.
 Visual Studios solution file is located in DungeonDelver folder.
